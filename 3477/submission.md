# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3477 - [LEARNING LOGS] Pad Thai
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
684295	

```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
15-30 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
Input: many lines of ingredients until the word “Cook”, then many lines of tastes until the word “End”.

Output: one message. If any ingredient is not on the chef’s list, print “This is not Pad Thai!!!” (this wins even if some ingredients are also missing). Otherwise, if some of the 11 ingredients are missing, print “This is bad!”. Otherwise, if the tastes are not exactly Sweet, Sour and Salty, print “Not Bad...”. If everything is correct, print “Delicious!”.

Constraints: the order of checking matters, because the messages have different priorities. Ingredients are checked first, then the tastes. I think the words must match the spelling in the statement exactly.

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
Step 1: Make a set of the 11 allowed ingredients and a set of the 3 good tastes.
Step 2: Read lines into a set used until I see “Cook”.
Step 3: Read lines into a set tastes until I see “End”.
Step 4: If used has anything outside the recipe, print “This is not Pad Thai!!!”.
Step 5: Else if used is not the full recipe, print “This is bad!”.
Step 6: Else if tastes is not exactly the
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
as same as first
```

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
ijudge
```

Input:

```text
Pad Thai Sauce

End
```

Expected output:

```text
This is bad!
```

Actual output:

```text
This is bad!
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2
